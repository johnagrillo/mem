  -> uses gif 0x....1234 
     -> access `gif.size` = 6
     -> gif.buffer is dangling (0x601000 was already deleted)

  -> destroys 0x....1234
    -> GifImage::~GifImage() @ 0x7ffc1234
      -> delete[] buffer at 0x601000 ️**Double delete!** → **undefined behavior**

  <- return 6  (but crash or heap corruption likely)
