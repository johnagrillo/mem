There are two functions here:
GifImage getGif();

    Builds a GifImage from raw data.

    Returns it by value (via a hidden pointer).

    Uses stack space to construct a temporary object.

main()

    Allocates space for the returned GifImage.

    Calls getGif() with a hidden pointer.

    Destroys the returned object afterward.
