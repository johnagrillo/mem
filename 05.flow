main():
  -> calls GifImage::GetGifPtr()
    -> allocates 16 bytes for GifImage on heap (operator new)
    -> prepares "GIF89a" bytes on stack as const char[6]
    -> calls GifImage::GifImage(char const*, unsigned long) constructor in-place
       -> sets this->size = 6
       -> allocates buffer = new char[6] on heap
       -> memcpy(buffer, "GIF89a", 6)
    <- returns pointer to GifImage instance (heap-allocated)

  <- returns pointer to GifImage (in rax)

  -> main loads GifImage pointer
  -> reads member at offset +8 (buffer pointer) from GifImage pointer
  <- returns buffer pointer

// **NO CALL TO delete OR operator delete**
// **NO DESTRUCTOR INVOCATION**
// The GifImage instance and internal buffer remain allocated on the heap indefinitely
